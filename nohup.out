  [37m So what is the gtm strategy for cope then? 
  
  I ask because (as was echo'd before) the project looks like its been abandoned... is this intentional? what is the goal for cope specifically, because it seems like all efforts to create any form of promotion is left up to the community.... will this continue to be the way for the project or do you envision a scenario where cope twitter feed comes back online? [0m
